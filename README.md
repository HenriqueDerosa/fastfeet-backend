# Fastfeet Backend

Developed with â™¡ for Rocketseat Challenge of Bootcamp GoStack

# Getting started

1. after cloning the repository, use `yarn` to download dependencies
2. You need these docker containers `redis:alpine` and `postgres`
3. Run docker containers `docker start <redis-container-name> <postgres-container-name>`
4. Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env` and make sure you filled all the fields correctly
5. run it locally using `yarn dev`
6. run queue by typing `yarn queue`

Don't forget to start docker containers before running the server

# What is the briefing

The main goal of these three repositories was to create a whole application from the backend, mobile and web frontend.
Here is the briefing:

# App responsibility

The backend handles all the database, background proccess, and has the power of receive and deliver informations, managing it for the client-side.

# Conclusion for the Backend

The backend was a critical part of this project, where I got stuck for a long time. Since the beginning of the Bootcamp, it was hard to understand it well enough. However, giving some effort on that, I finished it very happy and interested in knowing much more about backend, specifically with node.

The experience with Sequelize has got me in some troubles like having a table - gramatically wrong - called `deliverymens` ðŸ¤¯... or getting wrong data coming when I was associating things, the `as` in `hasMany` and other stuff, made me fall into a thought... `I don't like backend` ðŸ˜‚

Afterwards, everything was good. I learned Node, Express, Sequelize, a little bit of Redis, handlebars, and much more. In the experience of the last Omnistack week (#11), I was really impressed on how knex is easier, or clearer, or maybe I just didn't have a good _learning curve_ with Sequelize because I was starting.

Then, after these experiences, I am very excited to know more about backend, and focus on it for some of my personal projects.
